# 📖 Text-Based Course App

Hey! This is a full-stack project I built to help people create and take text-based courses. No fancy videos or AI distractions—just straightforward learning. I built this to practice connecting a React frontend with a real database and a live backend.

## 🛠️ What it does

* **Create Courses:** If you're an instructor, you can build a course step-by-step.
* **Student Mode:** Pick a course, read through the steps, and track your progress.
* **Dashboards:** Separate views for when you're teaching vs. when you're learning.
* **Live Accounts:** You can sign up, log in, and your data stays saved in a database (Supabase).

## 💻 The Tech

I used a few different tools to get this running:

* **The Front:** React with Tailwind CSS (hosted on **Netlify**).
* **The Back:** Node.js and Express (hosted on **Render**).
* **The Database:** PostgreSQL (managed by **Supabase**).

## 🚀 How to run it yourself

If you want to play around with the code locally, here's the quick version:

1. **Clone it:** `git clone https://github.com/bedena2000/text_based_courses_app.git`
2. **Frontend:** Go to the `frontend` folder, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.
3. **Backend:** Go to the `backend` folder, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.
4. **Envs:** Make sure to set up your `.env` files (you'll need a database URL).
